Build Report Inspector for Unity
================================

A Unity Editor tool for visualizing and analyzing build reports, helping you understand what's in your builds and optimize build size and time.

## What is it?

Unity generates a BuildReport file for Player builds and AssetBundles. This package provides a graphical inspector UI to explore that data directly in the Unity Editor, making it easy to:

- **Profile build times** - See which build steps take the longest
- **Analyze build size** - Understand what assets and objects contribute to your build footprint
- **Find duplicated content** - Identify assets duplicated across AssetBundles
- **Inspect output files** - View all files generated by the build
- **Review engine stripping** - See which modules are included and why

## Key Features

- **Multiple views** - [Build Steps](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/tab-build-steps.md), [Content Summary](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/tab-content-summary.md), [Source Assets](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/tab-source-assets.md), [Output Files](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/tab-output-files.md), and more
- **Mobile support** - [Additional insights](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/mobile.md) for Android and iOS builds
- **CSV export** - [Export data](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/exporting-and-analysis.md) for further analysis in external tools
- **AssetBundle analysis** - [Detect and resolve](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/tab-duplicated-assets.md) asset duplication issues
- **Collect history of past builds** - Menu shortcut that copies the most recent BuildReport into your project

## Status

This package is available as a preview and provided as-is. It serves as a demonstration of the BuildReport API capabilities and continues to work with recent Unity versions, including Unity 6.

## Getting Started

**Important:** The version on GitHub is more up to date than version 0.3 available through Unity Package Manager. We recommend installing directly from this repository to get the latest features and improvements.

See the [installation instructions](com.unity.build-report-inspector/Documentation~/com.unity.build-report-inspector.md#Installation) for step-by-step guidance on adding this package to your project.

**Quick start:** After installation, use `Window > Open Last Build Report` to view your most recent build.
