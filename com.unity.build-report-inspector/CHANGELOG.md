## [0.4.5-preview] - 2025-03-25

### Added
- Add tab for showing statistics about duplicated Assets.  Only shown for AssetBundle builds.  Similar to Addressables Report.
- Test Project - add example showing asset duplication, with a simple AssetBundle scenario
- Add Incremental AssetBundle Comparison script to Utilities (not directly related to BuildReportInspector but its used in the Test Project).  This was original published in this [Unity Discussions thread](https://discussions.unity.com/t/about-incremental-build-and-asset-bundle-hashes).

### Changed
- Change default sorting for SourceAssets to Importer Type (because the Size tab is the most likely to be too slow to use).

### Added
- Use AssetBundle name instead of internal file name in SourceAssets tab when sorting by output file path
