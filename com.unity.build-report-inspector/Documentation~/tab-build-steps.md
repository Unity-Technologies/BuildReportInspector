The equivalent information is exposed through the API by [BuildReport.steps](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.BuildReport-steps.html).

Note: when [BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport.html) is used then the build steps will include much more information. The amount of build step data generated by this flag is not appropriate for large builds, but can be useful when diagnosing issues with smaller player builds.
