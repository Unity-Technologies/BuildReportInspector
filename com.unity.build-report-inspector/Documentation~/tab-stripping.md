# Stripping Tab

For platforms which support engine code stripping, a list of all engine modules added to the build, and what caused them to be included in the build.

For the API equivalent see [StrippingInfo](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Build.Reporting.StrippingInfo.html).

This tab is only shown for Player builds because it is not relevant for AssetBundle builds.
